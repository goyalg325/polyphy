          PolyPhy is an interactive visualization and model-fitting tool that
          provides a novel approach to investigating cosmological datasets.
          Through a fast computational simulation method inspired by the
          behavior of Physarum polycephalum, a unicellular slime mold organism
          that efficiently forages for nutrients, astrophysicists can
          extrapolate from sparse datasets, such as galaxy maps archived in the
          Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and then use these extrapolations to inform
          analyses of a wide range of other data, such as spectroscopic
          observations captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. Researchers can
          interactively update the simulation by adjusting model parameters, and
          then investigate the resulting visual output to form hypotheses about
          the data. We describe details of PolyPhy's simulation model and its
          interaction and visualization modalities, and we evaluate PolyPhy
          through three scientific use cases that demonstrate the effectiveness
          of our approach.
          <br />
          <br />
          PolyPhy has two tightly coupled main components: simulation and
          visualization.
          <br />
          <br />
          The simulation component implements the MCPM algorithm to reconstruct
          an optimal transport network given a set of point data in 3D space.
          Such data can represent the distribution of galaxies or dark matter
          halos, typically on the scales of 100s of megaparsecs. MCPM uses a
          swarm of millions of particle-like agents to explore the simulation
          domain.
          <br />
          <br />
          The visualization component facilitates analysis tasks of the
          estimated network. Thanks to the interactive nature of PolyPhy, we can
          observe changes in the estimate in response to changing MCPM
          parameters. The main concern is whether the reconstruction fits the
          input data (i.e. all the input points are contained in it) as well as
          the plausibility of the obtained filamentary structures.
